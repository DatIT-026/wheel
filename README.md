# ⚠️ Support for the Wheel Project has ended
After 14 months, security updates and technical support for the Wheel Project ended on May 10, 2024.

## Info
This is the 6th project in the **Crazy Gifts** series. We are excited to introduce **The Wheel Project (Not Random)**.

The website is built using pure HTML and CSS, serving as a simple and solid foundation. Currently, it does not support generating random results, though this improvement is planned for future updates.

This project reached its end of life on **May 10, 2024**.
